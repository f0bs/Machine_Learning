    "<p><strong>This project must be successfully completed and submitted in order to receive credit for this course. Your score on this project will be included in your final grade calculation.</strong><p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>You are expected to write code where you see <em># YOUR CODE HERE</em> within the cells of this notebook. Not all cells will be graded; code input cells followed by cells marked with <em>#Autograder test cell</em> will be graded. Upon submitting your work, the code you write at these designated positions will be assessed using an \"autograder\" that will run all test cells to assess your code. You will receive feedback from the autograder that will identify any errors in your code. Use this feedback to improve your code if you need to resubmit. Be sure not to change the names of any provided functions, classes, or variables within the existing code cells, as this will interfere with the autograder. Also, remember to execute all code cells sequentially, not just those you’ve edited, to ensure your code runs properly.</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>You can resubmit your work as many times as necessary before the submission deadline. If you experience difficulty or have questions about this exercise, use the Q&A discussion board to engage with your peers or seek assistance from the instructor.<p>\n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Save your notebook.</strong></li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Mark as Completed —</strong> In the blue menu bar along the top of this code exercise window, you’ll see a menu item called <strong>Education</strong>. In the <strong>Education</strong> menu, click <strong>Mark as Completed</strong> to submit your code for autograder/instructor review. This process will take a moment and a progress bar will show you the status of your submission.</li>\n",
    "\t<li><strong>Review your results —</strong> Once your work is marked as complete, the results of the autograder will automatically be presented in a new tab within the code exercise window. You can click on the assessment name in this feedback window to see more details regarding specific feedback/errors in your code submission.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Repeat, if necessary —</strong> The Jupyter notebook will always remain accessible in the first tabbed window of the exercise. To reattempt the work, you will first need to click <strong>Mark as Uncompleted</strong> in the <strong>Education</strong> menu and then proceed to make edits to the notebook. Once you are ready to resubmit, follow steps one through three. You can repeat this procedure as many times as necessary.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "We have defined a PyTorch network class for you. What you need to do is to implement the forward pass for your deep averaging network. To start, first implement <code>average</code> that averages the words in a review and then implement <code>forward</code> that passes the \"averaged\" review to a linear layer to produce the model's belief.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `average` recall that multiplying the matrix of the bag-of-words with the word embeddings will get you the embedded representations for the reviews. You then want to average over all the different words in a review to get an \"average\" embedding for each review. Note that here, we compute a weighted average. I.e. Let $\\mathbf{E}\\in{\\mathcal{R}}^{r\\times v}$ be the embedding matrix (with embedding dimensionality $r$ and vocabulary size $v$). The $i^{th}$ column of $\\mathbf{E}$ is the embedding of word $i$ in the vocabulary (we denote it as $\\mathbf{E}[:,i]$). Further, let $\\mathbf{x}\\in{\\mathcal{R}}^{1\\times v}$ be a horizontal bag-of-words input vector. We compute the average embedding as follows:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{a}=\\frac{1}{\\sum_i \\mathbf{x}[i]}\\sum_{j}\\mathbf{E}[:,j]\\mathbf{x}[j]$$\n",
    "In the function you need to compute this average for each input vector (the input <code>x</code> is a list of inputs). \n",
